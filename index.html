          <h2>Netaji</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent Indian nationalist leader and one of the key figures in India's 
                struggle for independence from British colonial rule during the early 20th century. 
                Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Bose dedicated his life to the pursuit of freedom and the welfare of his fellow countrymen.

                Bose's political career began as a member of the Indian National Congress (INC), 
                the leading political party in the Indian independence movement. He rose through 
                the ranks and served as the President of the INC in 1938 and again in 1939. However, Bose became dissatisfied 
                with the party's leadership and their approach towards achieving independence. He advocated for militant nationalism 
                and rejected Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent approach.
                
                In 1939, Bose formed a new political party called the Forward Bloc. 
                The Forward Bloc aimed to unite all anti-colonial forces and actively fight against British imperialism. 
                Bose believed in taking direct action and mobilizing the masses for a strong and armed resistance against British rule.
                
                One of Bose's most significant contributions was the formation of the Azad Hind Fauj 
                (Indian National Army or INA) in 1942. Seeking support from Axis powers during World War II, 
                Bose aimed to raise an army that would fight alongside the Japanese against the British.
                 The INA waged a military campaign in Southeast Asia, and in 1944, under Bose's leadership, 
                 they launched an offensive against the British in Manipur, known as the Battle of Imphal. 
                 Although the INA achieved initial successes, they were eventually forced to retreat.
                
                The circumstances surrounding Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's death remain a subject of controversy. 
                In August 1945, his plane reportedly crashed in Taipei, Taiwan (then Formosa). 
                However, there are theories suggesting that he may have survived the crash and lived in hiding.
                 Despite the mystery surrounding his disappearance, Bose's charismatic leadership and unwavering commitment 
                 to India's freedom struggle have made him an iconic figure in Indian history.
                
                Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is revered as a national hero in India. His birth anniversary,
                 January 23, is celebrated as "Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Jayanti.
                 " His contributions to the independence movement continue to inspire generations of Indians, and he
                  remains an important symbol of courage, determination, and sacrifice in the fight against colonialism.
